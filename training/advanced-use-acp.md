Learn how to deploy applications in Kubernetes using Drone and ephemeral namespaces. Create, manage and debug secrets and configs in Kubernetes, deploy locally to Minikube and create and destroy namespaces for ephemeral deployments with Drone and Kubernetes.  

Install Kubectl, Minikube and docker before the workshop and make sure you have access to the VPN.  [Install these here](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/application-container-platform).
